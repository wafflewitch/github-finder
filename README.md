This is a simple React app to search for GitHub users and display information about a selected user. It heavily utilizes prop drilling only as a learning experience. It was made by following Brad Traversy's "React Front to Back" course on Udemy. A more finessed version utilizing hooks can be found in my repo called "github-finder-with-hooks".
